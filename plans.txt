======= Components Responsability ======================

### App ###
  App is responsible for the initial configuration on componentWillMount and componentWillUnmount it is a connected Component.
  we should expose a SET_SETUP action for this component but I think will be fine with SET_SORT and SET_PAGINATION.

### Header ###
  Header is a render-only component that will show the description of the app that exist on the index.html and the first Ad.

### InfiniteScrollGrid ###
  The parent and connected component of the grind control I am developing, It will be responsible of rendering rows,
  managing sorting and scrolling events, managing what is being viewed or not, managing rendering of rows.

### GridHeader ###
  It should render the top header buttons that will decide what fields will be sorted, when clicking a header it will activate
  or desactivate sorting. When sorting is desactivated is defaulted to id.

### GridContainer ###
  Just renders childrens and the markup of the inside body

### AdRow ###
  A row with an AD

### FaceRow ### DONE
  A row with a Face and the 3 fields size, price and date

### LoadingRow ###
  A Loading Row when app is still fetching data and all the rows have been shown

### EndRow ###
  A End of products Row show when app have fetched and shown all the rows
